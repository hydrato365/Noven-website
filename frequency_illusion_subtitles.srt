1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You learn a new word, and suddenly you hear it everywhere.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
That's not magic.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's your brain playing a trick called the frequency illusion, or the Bottermeinhoff effect.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Once your mind is primed, it starts spotting that word, car, or name again and again.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You think it's appearing more, but it was always there.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You just started noticing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Your brain filters reality more than you realize.
